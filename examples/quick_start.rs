//! The README's quick start, runnable anywhere: no Steam client, no network. It uses the in-memory
//! `FakeSteamBackend`, so the whole flow is deterministic:
//!
//! 1. host a friends-only lobby with two data keys (`LobbyCreated`),
//! 2. a (simulated) friend invites us to their lobby (`JoinRequested`),
//! 3. the game accepts by sending `JoinLobby` (the plugin never joins by itself),
//! 4. we leave our own lobby and enter theirs (`LobbyLeft`, `LobbyEntered`) and read its data.
//!
//! `cargo run --example quick_start`
